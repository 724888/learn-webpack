## About Webpack 
&ensp;&ensp; Webpack is module loader developed by German developer Tobias Koppers.

&ensp;&ensp; All files in webpack will be used as modules. When webpack processes an application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that contains every module the application needs, and then packages all those modules into one or more bundles.

## Contrast with Gulp/Grunt
&ensp;&ensp; Webpack is not comparable to Gupl/Grunt because Gupl/Grunt is a tool that optimizes the front-end development process and webpack is a modular solution. However, the advantages of webpack make webpack in many scenarios can replace Gulp/Grunt category of tools.
