## About Webpack 
&ensp;&ensp; webpack is module loader developed by German developer Tobias Koppers.

&ensp;&ensp; All files in webpack will be used as modules. When webpack processes an application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that contains every module the application needs, and then packages all those modules into one or more bundles.
