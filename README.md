## About Webpack 
&ensp;&ensp; Webpack is module loader developed by German developer Tobias Koppers.

&ensp;&ensp; All files in webpack will be used as modules. When webpack processes an application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that contains every module the application needs, and then packages all those modules into one or more bundles.

## Contrast with Gulp/Grunt
&ensp;&ensp; Webpack is not comparable to Gupl/Grunt because Gupl/Grunt is a tool that optimizes the front-end development process and webpack is a modular solution. However, the advantages of webpack make webpack in many scenarios can replace Gulp/Grunt category of tools.

&ensp;&ensp; Grunt and Gulp work in the following ways: In a configuration file,you specify the specific steps to perform similar tasks such as compiling, assembling, and compressing certain files taht the tool can then automate for you.

&ensp;&ensp; Webpack work in the following ways: Think of your project as a whole, and through a given master file (eg,index.js), Webpack will find all the dependencies for your project from this file, process them with loaders, and finally package it into on (or more) browser-aware JavaScript file.

## webpack installation and use （[Demo1 Source](https://github.com/SilenceHVK/learn-webpack/tree/master/demo1)）

1. Install [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) golbally via npm.
```bash
    $ npm install -g webpack
```

2. Create the project and initialize the package.json file.
```bash
    $ mkdir demo1 && cd demo1
    $ npm init
```

3. Install webpack in the project.
```bash
    $ npm install webpack --save-dev
```
> --save-dev is dependent on the development time, - save is also dependent on the release of things.

4. Create the following file structure in the project.
<pre>
.        
├── index.html  // Web page display
├── main.js    // Webpack entrance
└── bundle.js // Files generated by the webpack command do not need to be created
</pre>


5. Package the js files dependent on the project with the command.
```bash
    # webpack Js file name to be packaged. Generated after the package js file name.
    $ webpack main.js bundle.js
```

&ensp;&ensp;Following the webpackage command can also add the following parameters.
- ``` --watch ``` Real-time packaging.
- ``` --progress ``` Display package progress.
- ``` --display-modules ``` Display the packaged modules.
- ``` --display-reasons ``` Display reasons about module inclusion in the  output.

&ensp;&ensp;More parameters can be viewd by the command ``` webpack --help ``` .

## Four core cocnepts in webpack（[Demo2 Source](https://github.com/SilenceHVK/learn-webpack/tree/master/demo2)）
1. [Entry](#user-content-entry)
2. [Output](#user-content-output)
3. [Loaders](#user-content-loaders)
4. [Plugins](#user-content-plugins)

&ensp;&ensp;The default configuration file name in webpack is webpack.config.json,so we need to create the following file in the project:
<pre>
.        
├── index.html            // Web page display
├── main.js              // Webpack entrance
├── webpack.config.js   // The default configuration file in webpack
└── bundle.js          //  Files generated by the webpack command do not need to be created
</pre>

### Entry
&ensp;&ensp;The entry point indicates which module webpack should use as the start of building its internal dependency graph.

&ensp;&ensp;You can configure the entry property in webpack.config.js to specify an entry of multiple entry points as follows:
```javascript
    module.exports = {
        entry: './path/entryFile.js'
    }
```

### Output
&ensp;&ensp;The output property tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files. You can configure this part of the process by specifying an output field in your configuration:
```javascript
    const path = require('path')

    module.exports = {
        entry: './path/entryFile.js',
        output: {
            path: path.resolve(__dirname,'dist'),
            filename: 'my-webpack.bundle.js'
        }
    }
```
&ensp;&ensp; The output.path property is used to specify the path to the generated file, and output.filename is used to specify the name of the generated file.

### Loaders
### Plugins

&ensp;&ensp; If you want to change default profile name, you can configur in package.json.
```bash

```
